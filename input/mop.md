## {{ hl("about", "About MOP") }}

This section of the website is dedicated to public-facing
material from various years of MOP.
It's similar in spirit to the [MOPper world](http://moppers.kaseorg.com/)
that ran between 1997 and 2004.
This page isn't a puzzle.

MOP is a three-week camp now held at [CMU](https://cmu.edu).
In 2020 and 2021, the camp was run on Discord.
Prior to 2015, the camp was held in [Nebraska](https://unl.edu).
See [FAQ CR-7](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-7)
for invitation rules.

Today, the camp is headed by director
[Po-Shen Loh](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/cmu.shtml)
and assistant academic director [Evan Chen](index.html).
(There is no academic director or assistant director.)
Staff includes instructors, [RA][ra]'s, and
teaching assistants (aka graders).

[ra]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_assistant

For many years, the official name for MOP was "MOSP",
but the letter S was universally ignored by staff and students,
and its omission became an ongoing gag.
The S was finally officially deleted in 2017.

## {{ hl("tshirt", "T-shirt designs") }}

Traditionally, MOP T-shirts are printed in black on grey.
Except for 2020 and 2021, there is usually only a front design,
and the back contains everyone's signature.

{{ tshirt(2016) }}
{{ tshirt(2017) }}
{{ tshirt(2018, alt = "2018; reference to 2017 G8.") }}
{{ tshirt(2019, alt = "2019; reference to ELMO 2019/2.") }}
{{ tshirt(2020) }}
{{ tshirt(2020, alt = "2020; reverse.", ext = "back.png") }}
{{ tshirt(2021, alt = "2021; reference to USAMO 2021/3.") }}
{{ tshirt(2021, alt = "2021; reverse.", ext = "back.png") }}
{{ tshirt(2022, alt = "2022; reference to USAMO 2022/2") }}
{{ tshirt(2023, alt = "2023; reference to USAMO 2023/1") }}

## {{ hl("problems", "Problems") }}

- The **ELMO** is written by returning MOPpers for new MOPpers,
  featuring "teams" and coordination.
  See [ELMO page](https://web.evanchen.cc/elmo/general.html).
- The **Mock IMO** is run by staff using [ISL](faq-rules.html#CR-11);
  it also features a mock
  [coordination](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-10).
  It's one of several practice tests run by the staff at MOP each year.
  You can download the problems here:

- The staff also provide **MOP homework** to work on before camp starts,
  mostly for fun and so people have something to talk about at airports.
  Here are recent homework problems:

## {{ hl("schedules", "Schedules") }}

Here are calendars for recent years of MOP:

<div class="chooser list-chooser" markdown="block">

- [2021](static/mop/schedules/2021.pdf)

</div>

For more concrete times, here was the 2022 weekday timetable as an example
(which should be read alongside the
[2022 calendar](static/mop/schedules/2022.pdf)):

- `07:00-09:00` Breakfast
- `09:00-10:30` Morning class 1
- `10:40-12:10` Morning class 2
- `12:10-13:20` Lunch
- Exactly one of:
  - `13:20-14:50` Afternoon class,
  - `13:20-17:50` Mock olympiad / Team Selection Test, OR
  - `13:20-14:00` Assembly meeting (for announcements, etc.)
- `17:00-20:00` Dinner hours
- `19:15-20:00` Test review (presenting solutions to test problems)
  OR seminar on higher math (both optional)
- `22:30-23:00` Evening check-in

There is a lot of free time built into the schedule, and this is intentional.
Some examples of recent activities include singing troupe (see below),
the double-elimination fish tournament, the plank countdown,
trips to Waffallonia, dance tutorials,
live-action Mafia and StarCraft (both no longer banned),
and too many water balloons.

## {{ hl("singing", "Singing troupe") }}

The MOP Singing Troupe is a tradition dating back to around 2010,
started by Evan o'Dorney; it starts and ends the closing ceremony.
Here are recent songs we performed:
